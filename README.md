CODEBYVOICE
===========

a text editor that can be controlled by voice

The idea was to implement a text editor using python and voice control

The project uses basic python tkinter and pyspeech to build the voice based editor

At current time project works only on windows as Pyspeech works only for windows

by default pyspeech uses microsoft speech sdk built in to win OS
